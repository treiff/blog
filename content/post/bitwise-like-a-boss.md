## The problem

Lately, I've been back at it with rust. Particurally, I'm all in on building a [chip-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) emulator. Things have been going really well, but one thing I relized is dealing with binary and hex really isn't my forte.  That said since the struggle is real, I figured jotting down some of what I learned might possibly help someone out in the future.

```rust
  fn main() {
      println!("here is some code");
  }
```
